                    This project was built using Visual Studio 2015 and the ASP.NET framework.
                    This project is being served via IIS running on a AWS t.2 micro instance. 
                    The Google Maps API is being used to deliver the mapping content. 
                    Bootstrap was used as the framework for the webpage with credit
                    given to <a href="http://bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/google-maps">bootstrapzero</a>
                    for a starting template.

                    The largest challange I encountered was figuring out how to get the Google Maps API to work with Bootstrap.
                    Initially, I tried to use the JavaScript code direct from the Google API page, but the map would not render
                    inside the Bootstrapped page. If I removed the Bootstrap functionality from the page everything worked fine. 
                    After some research, I discovered that I needed to create an event listener that would initialize the function 
                    after the page had finished loading. After setting up the listener, I no longer had any issues. A smalller issue
                    that I encountered was making the pages respond appropriately for its intended destination. I originally
                    developed the page on a very large monitor, but it was intended to be displayed on a 980px wide section in my
                    portfolio. This was the main reason for using the bootstrap framework. I was able to develop a suitable 
                    compromise for both my large screen monitor and a smaller display.
                </p>

                    I also experiement with a JQuery API titled gmap3. I eventually commneted this code out from the project, but I
                    found the gmap3 API much easier to work with and will likely build all of my professional maps with this
                    API in the future. I downloaded the JQuery plugin from <a href="https://github.com/jbdemonte/gmap3.git">GitHub </a>.
                    If you would like to see the code for this project you could  examine the developer tools or it can be found here 
                    on <a href="https://github.com/dunhamspatial/lesson3">GitHub</a>.
